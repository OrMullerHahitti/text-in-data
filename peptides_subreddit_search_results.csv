bpc-157 lasting damage?,33,12kp497,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/12kp497/bpc157_lasting_damage/,93,1681392299.0,"Hello my friends,

I read a bunch of threads about the side effects of bpc-157 and the most frightening side effect is this persistent anhedonia, which few reports. Others report long or lasting  depression or anxiety while others say it has helped them and their mood is better than before. I'm really unsure because I also know a lot of healthy bodybuilders who report no side effects at all and swear that it's absolutely safe how can that be? Is it just scaremongering or is there any truth to these side effects?",BeneficialArt6797

BPC 157 and Cancer Growth,42,1d1fsm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/1d1fsm9/bpc_157_and_cancer_growth/,73,1716771500.0,"Hey all,

I'm a Biotech student and was curious if there's been any consideration that BPC 157 may actually reduce cancer risk or growth due to competitive factors.

Cancerous tumors ask for greater blood supply to grow quicker, starving nearby cells leading to cell death

But if BPC 157 is a *potent* angiogenic VEGF expressor, then could it perhaps bring the rest of the system's angiogenic basely up to a level that may affectively compete with the cancer for bloodflow? 

This thought process comes to me through the thought of different bacteria competing within a microbiome, expressing different antibiotics and such to ensure they can grow at a quicker rate than the other. 

Additionally, I feel that if cancer expresses more angiogenic factors than a non-cancerous cell, it wouldnt do so at a potent level but rather express them at the same rate but without pause since they wish for constant growth whereas a normal cell will slow or stop this expression if it doesn't need it. As such, if cancer cells don't express *potent* angiogenic factors, but rather just release then unrelentingly, then perhaps using something *potent* like BPC 157 could allow for the system to then compete and sustain the nutrition & blood supply it needs.

This is definitely something I'd love to hypothesize and test in a lab lol but of course we know how peptides are viewed in the pharmaceutical industry currently, so instead I'll just hypothesize and share with the community in the case someone else that comes across this is a biotechnologist but rich and could pay to be able to test this if they wish haha

BPC 157 / TB 500 tendinitis experience,20,1cnx3vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/1cnx3vj/bpc_157_tb_500_tendinitis_experience/,36,1715260749.0,"**tl;dr I would strongly and without reservation recommend this combo to anyone with tendinitis. Remember that you still have to do the work though!**

Me: late 40's, very active, skier, hiker. Former big drinker, now down to approx two drinks per week, following the advice of Peter Attia and Andrew Huberman and focusing on sleep, cardio, strength, etc etc. 

Issues: persistent, severe Achilles tendinitis, beginning during a period of excessive sprinting and insufficient rest two years ago. Daily pain upon waking, generally between 2/10, which I would consider normal, up to 5 or 6/10 (hobbling walk upon rising) in periods where I'm hiking or biking a lot. No running at all since the issue started, as I found that running is highly aggravating. Also, intermittent patellar tendinitis in my left knee, generally only during periods of intense use, such as skiing or hiking. A hiking trip last summer resulted in severe pain, and the inability to walk downhill after five days of long steep hikes. I do the Knees Over Toes (KoT) bodyweight exercises, and I have greatly reduced mobility in my left knee, which is apparent when I do the stepdown exercise (Patrick step) - I can only lower my right foot about half a step, while I could probably do a full pistol squat on my good knee.

I started BPC 157 and TB 500 at 100mcg each twice per day, and quickly scaled up to 300mcg each twice per day. I injected subq in my stomach, although I tried at the sites of pain a few times, and didn't notice any difference. I ran these for six weeks, ish, and am now taking a break before my next course.

Results: nothing short of miraculous. Within two days there was no pain at all upon waking, 0/10, for literally the first time in two years. I have been able to do KoT much more regularly and I'm getting a vastly increased range of motion under load in my left knee, probably to something like 70% of my good knee. The Achilles exercises prescribed by my PT are not aggravating, meaning they don't result in increased pain the next day, and I can walk and ruck long distances without any issue. Unfortunately, after approx three weeks, I got overconfident and did a sprint session, which brought back the pain. My PT told me that sprinting (along with jumping) is basically max load for the Achilles, to not do it again, and to start running slowly, which I haven't done yet (got enough to work on, and waiting for a long period of zero pain before I start). She also sent me to an ortho, who did x-rays, found no evidence of physical damage, and told me basically to keep doing what I'm doing and to wear non-zero-drop shoes if I'm going to be standing or walking a lot. Two weeks after that meeting, the morning pain is gone again, even though I'm currently off the peptides, and I'm contemplating a return to running when I start my next round. 

I also have issues with addiction, and I have experienced a pretty significant drop in impulses and a better resistance to triggers. I'm better at focusing too, although that may just be from the trigger-blunting effect. I hadn't noticed this until someone posted a question here about recovery from cocaine use, and it wasn't why I started, but I think the effect is real and potentially very interesting for anyone who tends to be scattered and impulsive.

Lessons learned: although BPC / TB is pretty close to a magic bullet for tendinitis, it isn't one, and it's important for users to keep in mind what got them to the point of disability in the first place and to stick to a thoughtful and careful progression. I also am not 100% sure if the miraculous effects are primarily from the anti-inflammatory effect of the TB or the tendon repair effects of the BPC. I wish I had done some imaging before starting the course. I am pretty confident that there has been actual repair to the damaged tendons - I no longer feel areas of thickening or roughness along the heel cord. I also wish I had measured knee mobility under load on both sides before starting. 

The other thing I'd do differently is buy a blend instead of individual bottles of each peptide. I have a horrible time mixing in the syringe, with one or the other of the bottles normally producing a bubble instead of liquid. I'm using CJC and Ipamorelin now and having the same issue, which is infuriating.

I've tried searching but I can't find a definite answer.

I'm in the UK looking for BPC 157 and I have a choice between 

BPC 157 - CAS 137525-51-0 - formula C62 H98 N16 O22

BPC 157 ACETATE - CAS 168202-19-6 - formula as above but with extra XC2 H4 O2

I've gotten myself confused because looking at various shops they list either one or the other. Some shops have wild datasheets with a mix up of CAS numbers and formulas.

How is BPC 157 so good?,31,14sp4iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/14sp4iu/how_is_bpc_157_so_good/,90,1688684947.0,"I'm using oral BPC from BioPrime (no affiliation) every now and then during travel to sleep and recover my whole body faster.

And even the occasional 250ug help me sooo much that I'm actually concerned about any long term side effects. 

Like, it seems impossible to not have any trade offs, is there really nothing I should be concerned about?

Edit

Positive effects: 
- When I go to bed later than usual, I'm still in solid shape in the morning, with less sleep.
- When I drink alcohol, I have no hangover. 
- When I eat before sleeping, my sleep is still very restorative. 
- When I take it in the morning, I have a lot of mental clarity and energy, can push hard workouts despite stress.
- No travel fatigue.
- Fast recovery from workout injuries.

The only negative effect I've experienced is slight anxiety. Like, the feeling of uncertainty that makes me write this post. I have something similar with psychedelics too, it either feels amazing or it gives me slight anxiety, depending on the context I'm in.",kischiman

Oral BPC-157 experience,31,18w35uh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/18w35uh/oral_bpc157_experience/,33,1704134242.0,"I primarily lurk around this and related subs but I figured I owed a post regarding oral BPC given that it’s asked about a lot but really doesn’t show up, especially as it relates to non-gut issues.

TLDR; I got the one from infiniwell and it’s been amazing! Oral BPC-157 does indeed work for non-gastro issues.

I’m 34, 6’3”, 240lb at the moment, not in great shape. Taking enclomiphene (3.25mg daily, only started 11 days ago). 

I’ve had a lingering ankle ligament issues (inferior fibular retinaculum, just under the outside ankle bone), that has had me hobbled for roughly 6 months — to the point where just going on a 15 min walk results in me having to sit down and rub my ankle for hours. As you can imagine it’s been horrid for my physical life, I stopped working out and put on about 15lb, while losing muscle. I’ve seen doctors who haven’t really been able to figure out what’s going on, other than it just being a strain that I need to rest. The only relief I have been able to find to a certain degree has been these puma shoes I got from Costco, for some reason with them I was able to walk 15-20 min without intense pain (but pain nonetheless).

The ankle issue was at the point where I’d beg my kids and wife to give me ankle massages on a daily basis (eventually my kids just started avoiding me in the living room lol). Spent hundreds on massages and PT. Started to google ways to heal ankle problems and eventually got a Facebook ad from Transcend about igf lr3 which led me down the route of looking through all sorts of peptides and research for about 5-6 weeks (huge thank you to this community!). Eventually found bpc-157 and peptide sciences who sells oral bpc (with tb4) for $320, which is a pretty good hunk of change. So really went after it and have found that there’s not much anecdotal evidence out there on this for non-gut issues. Was going to just get the injectable (fear was not pinning but rather reconstituting since I’m very new to all this), but got yet another Facebook ad from infiniwell, who’s oral BPC was significantly cheaper and it had a coupon code. Decided what the hell, I already spent hundreds to no avail, may as well try this at $100 (opted for the 500mg delayed release)

Greatest decision I have ever made regarding supplementation. I took 1x/daily first thing in the morning, fasted and didn’t eat for another 2 hours. Within a couple days the pain itself was FULLY masked, my quality of life shot through the roof. I know many will be inclined to say this was a placebo effect, but I personally can’t buy into that given the extreme pain I’d been dealing with. Also physically the swelling had gone down to the nothing. Over the course of the month, I regained the ability to actually rotate and turn my ankle; to a degree better than I had pre ligament injury. As an added benefit, something that really didn’t hit me until this morning — knee pain that I periodically have had in my left knee has not popped up once since I started BPC; even when doing heavy leg extensions, which used to be a guaranteed way to get a flare up. I’ve also had shoulder issues (left rotator cuff) since I was 20 years old and a big time ego lifter. While this chronic injury is nowhere near “fixed” and there is still pain, it’s dulled and more importantly I’m physically capable of doing full ROM lateral raises; something that has not been possible since college. 

BPC has genuinely changed my life, I’m really hoping the healing progress continues over the course of the year.

I am thinking about trying the rapid release, but I figure I shouldn't mess with something thats doing so well right now lol.",ThetaKing1

Starting taking it to assist in recovery of a broken foot (jones fracture) + sprain I sustained from a sports injury. Prior to BPC was dealing with many ailments main ones being  Severe joint pain, impinged shoulder (for 6 years), lower back pain, GERD (heartburn), stomach tightness, throat irritation + spasms, esophagitis, severe brain fog, eye vision blurriness, high blood pressure.

I started slow in dosing (half) and then increased to about 0.3mg X2 a day. Was doing one injection in belly fat and the other near the ankle. Switched the last few days to one 0.3mg injection and moved the location of the injection closer to where i was feeling pain.

I had completely cutout caffeine and adderall (for my ADHD) for the last month post injury but decided to take it again starting the other day for focus issues. Those supplements should inhibit good effects since they are vasoconstrictive but i have no clue, it feels like it jumpstarted something (or the timing was coincidental).

I also **Always** get immediate bowel movement on even small doses of caffeine, its basically a laxative for me. I drank 3x my normal amount yesterday coming off intolerance to it and felt absolutely nothing (was freaked out by this). 

I went to bed and woke up with No Joint Pain. No Neck pain. No knee pain. No shoulder pain. I am breathing normally, i thought caffeine would make my GERD skyrocket and I was able to skip taking a PPI yesterday and feel fine despite trying to get off it last week and have acid rebound. My eyesight feels improved, my brain fog is gone.

The only thing it did not improve was my blood pressure which I have to work on.

I am not sure if it just took a week to kick in or what miracle brought this upon me, but I haven't felt like this since I was 19. It is such a contrast that it's fucking with my brain right now. Will I stay feeling like this, bruh, i want that.",Quantum__Tarantino

Diagen is trying to sell the patent rights for BPC-157 Stable (Arg-BPC),11,1cegrqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/1cegrqx/diagen_is_trying_to_sell_the_patent_rights_for/,0,1714230717.0,"[https://www.bpc157.si/bpc-157-stable-patent-rights-for-sale/](https://www.bpc157.si/bpc-157-stable-patent-rights-for-sale/)

This isn't surprising to me.. Diagen is a small company, and they were never really equipped to bring BPC-157 to market. As far as I can tell, the closest they got to monetizing it was selling it for veterinary/apiary use through third parties. It's possible some of the supplement-style arg-BPC products out there are using Diagen BPC-157, but I think they're just ignoring the patent.

Diagen patented a few versions over the decades, most recently BPC-157 Stable (arg-BPC) which is the only active patent. Arg-BPC is more stable in acidic environments (like stomach acid) in comparison with the acetate version (although it's not impervious to acid). The patent for BPC-157 acetate has expired. [I have some patent and human trial info in my Primer if you're interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Peptides/comments/13ft3g9/peptide_primer_30_is_here_it_covers_dosage/).

So if someone bought the rights to arg-BPC, and got a product to market (probably for a GI condition of some kind), the selection of available arg-BPC products might change. But I wouldn't expect the research-use-only landscape to change much, especially in regards to the more common acetate version.

This post was removed from the Crohn’s Disease subreddit. Hopefully it’s more welcome here.

I just wanted to share my experience with BPC-157. I’m not encouraging anyone else to try it, but thought my anecdotal experience may be of interest.

I’ve had Crohn’s for 12 years now, and in that time only really had one short but sweet period I would call remission. I’ve tried many treatments, and I’m
currently on infliximab every 6 weeks. I exercise regularly, and have my diet narrowed down to 90% Chicken and Rice. If I eat something different, I know there’s going to be consequences. This rigidity has allowed me to live a manageable life. I use the toilet 2-3 times a day and my stool is on the soft side but is mostly formed, which compared to how it’s been is manageable.

With all that I mind, I was still frustrated that I felt like I had maxed out what I could expect for my disease management, so I’ve been increasingly drawn to alternatives.

I’m not going to summarise the research here, I don’t want to serve as anyone’s primary source of knowledge on this, but what I will say is that I have a background in molecular biology and biochemistry, and I’m not incapable of interpreting and critically appraising the current state of research. I encourage you to investigate for yourself.

After looking into it I decided that I wanted to try sub-cutaneous injections. I bought my BPC from a company that provides third party testing results which I could verify. I also found a post from another Redditor who had access to HPLC through their work and was able to verify the content testing for my chosen supplier. 

The BPC came as a lyophilised powder which I resuspended in bacteriostatic water. I have now been injecting 250ug twice a day into my belly for a week.

On day one I noticed that my usual intermittent pain was decreased. By day 3 I was passing ‘normal’ stool once a day. I have only had the most mild intestinal pain since. I’m genuinely mind blown. All of this was a week prior to my infusion, which is usually a period of increased symptoms for me. I purchased enough for 20 days. I’m currently thinking about extending this to 40 and then coming off it to observe what happens. My intended use for now will be cycles as and when I need it, as opposed to daily use.

I’m not trying to encourage anyone else with IBD. I’m currently sat getting my infusion feeling better than I have in a long time. People are right to state that there is limited research on the efficacy in humans. But that doesn’t mean that anecdotes are worthless to everyone.",Knitty_Shickers

So my question is, if it's taken orally I'm assuming it does not absorb as well so that's why they recommend 1000mcg/daily?  Asumming maybe only 600mcg is absorbed of the full 1000mcg?  I just want to make sure I don't start off with a side effect.
